### Half time event

# Question 1 - What is your project goal? How did it change?
 Providing users the possibility to compare two or more articles about the same topics, written by different autors. We decided to work with dummy articles, so we can focus on the development side of the project instead of losing time trying to find the data.



# Question 2 - What are the most important milestones you have achieved?
 We made a user story map that guides us in our development of the website. By creating multiple user journeys we have a well defined MVP and an optional release. Also we agreed on a layout for the main page.


# Question 3 - What is the next milestone you are working towards?
 Setting up the skeleton for our development: getting the backend set up using Express.js & MongoDB, getting a React page to render a list of dummy articles.


# Question 4 - What is the biggest challenge you are facing right now?
 Making the technical side of things work together. Using new technologies to solve problems.


# Question 5 - What do you like about working with your mentor?
 Diego guides us trough our project by giving us a structured workflow that doesn't let us derail from our project goals. He shows us useful tools and resources that get us ahead faster and more efficienty. Also, he's in a reggaeton-band!! :-D
